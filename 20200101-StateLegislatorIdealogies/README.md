> State legislator ideologies. Political scientists Boris Shor and Nolan McCarty’s have assigned ideology scores, on a conservative-to-liberal scale, to every US lawmaker in all 50 state legislatures. The most recent update, published May 2018, covers more than 22,000 legislators from 1993 through 2016. Shor and McCarty derived the numeric scores from a combination of legislative voting records and responses to Vote Smart’s “Political Courage Test.”
