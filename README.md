# Fun with Pandas

## Project overview
This is a hobby repo for exploration of data sets published in the [Data is Plural newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural), mostly as a way to get more familiar with Pandas and related data science tools in Python. The intent (and we'll see if I manage to stick with it), is to pick a dataset from each issue of the newsletter and explore it with Pandas. The exact goal of each exploration is as yet undetermined.

## Repo structure
The root of the repo has the `venv` definition used to set up the virtual environment I'll be using. For each dataset, I'll create a directory under this repo root to house the analysis scripts and into which I'll download the raw data. Raw data will not be committed to the repo but a README in each dataset directory will provide links where I'm accessing them.
